//Write and test a function that counts the number of peaks and the number of valleys in a dynamic,
//sequential structure of integers. A peak is an element of the structure that is greater than its two adjacent neighbors. 
//A valley is an element of the structure that is less than its two adjacent neighbors. 
//The first and last elements of the structure are adjacent neighbors.
//The function returns the number of peaks and the number of valleys in the structure. 
//The function has only one parameter – the sequential structure, returns only one structure – the number of peaks 
//and the number of valleys, uses neither global nor file scope user-defined objects, and uses neither input nor output streams.
